Before we continue, let's have a quick look at how Metamask works behind the scenes, because maybe
that's not exactly clear how that magic trickery here actually works, that metamask gets access to the blockchain.
Does it have its own node or how does it work?
And so what I kind of want to answer in these few slides is what's that magic box?
How does that how does that how does that even work?
So there is no magic trickery.
There is a service provider called Infura, or at least it was I'm not sure if they still with Infura,
but I think they are still within Infura and is running its own blockchain nodes internally in the data centers.
And they have convenient access to those blockchain nodes and the blockchain nodes itself, they are
storing or they are syncing the data with the blockchain and always keeping it up to date. And then you have an RPC.
A method or a REST interface or a web socket interface to actually connect to those blockchain nodes.
But it's going by Infura.
There is a couple of others that are not popping up every now and then.
Alchemy is one and there are more of them.
So running a blockchain or keeping it in sync is really a pain sometimes, especially if you want to
have a high degree of uptime, a load balance for many users.
So that one is totally abstracted away, all that metamask as it's conveniently connecting to Infura data centers.
I think they're running on AWS, but not sure and then connecting the blockchain nodes
there and Infura is doing the heavy lifting.
